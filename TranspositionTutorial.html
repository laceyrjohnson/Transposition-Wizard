        <h2 class= "underline" style="font-family: 'Lora', sans-serif;font-size:150%">Concert &amp; Written Pitch</h2>
            <p>Concert pitch is the sounding pitch that is created by a musician on their instrument. For instance, if members of a concert band were asked to play a Concert Bb, every instrument would perform the same (unison) sounding pitch (though in different octaves).</p>
            <p>Written pitch is the pitch the musician reads to know what sound to produce on their instrument. If members of a concert band were asked to play "their" Bb, the instruments would no longer play the same unison pitch.</p>

        <h2 class= "underline" style="font-family: 'Lora', sans-serif;font-size:150%">Transposing, Non-Transposing, &amp; Octave-Displaced Instruments</h2>
            <p>When an instrument's concert pitch and written pitch are the same, the instrument is a "non-transposing" instrument. If the musician reads and performs a note (such as a Bb), they will make the sound of a Bb when playing the instrument.</p>
            <p>When an instrument's concert pitch and written pitch are different, the instrument is a "transposing instrument". The musician will read and perform a note (such as a Bb), but the sound of the pitch will be called something else (such as "C").</p>
            <p>Instruments are often named after the alteration required to transpose to and from a C in concert pitch. For instance, when a Bb instrument (such as a Bb Clarinet) plays a written Bb, the sound is the concert pitch of C. When an Eb instrument (such as Eb Alto Sax) plays a written Eb, the sound is a concert C. When an F instrument (such as the F Horn) plays a written F, the sound is a concert C. For more information on how to transpose for each instrument, click the instrument's link below.</p>
            <p>Finally, when an instrument's concert pitch and written pitch differ precisely by one or more octaves, the instrument is an "octave-displaced" instrument. For instance, the musician reads and performs a note (such as Bb), and the instrument will sound a Bb in a different octave (such as a Bb in a lower octave). </p>

    <h2 class= "underline" style="font-family: 'Lora', sans-serif;font-size:150%">Why Do Some Instruments Transpose?</h2>
    <p>While transposition requires additional work for composers, arrangers, and conductors, transposition is helpful for the instrumentalist. Without transposition, music for some instruments would be written in awkward, hard-to read places on the staff, requiring numerous ledger lines and sometimes multiple octaves. In addition, transposition allows musicians to more easily switch between instruments of the same family. For instance, the fingerings for each written pitch for an Alto Sax and Tenor Sax are exactly the same, though the sound produced will be different.</p>
